# Description: The script calculated group mean pupil dilation and excludes noisy participants
# Noise is calculated based on the "derivative" (i.e., change in pupil size relative to the preceding sample; 
#                                                aka,  sample N - sample N-1 pupil size)
# Steps:
# 1. Load aligned pupil data
# 2. Create a distribution of the "derivatives"
# 3. Calculate the cutoff from the distribution (e.g., 1 SD, 2 SD, 3 SD)
# 4. Exclude participants if 25% data points are above/below the cutoff
# i.e., if 25% of the data points have a derivative greater/less than the cutoff, exclude the participant
